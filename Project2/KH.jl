# This script simulates Kelvin-Helmholtz instability in 2D using Oceananigans

# Load some standard libraries that we will need
using Printf, Statistics
using Oceananigans

# First, we need to set some physical parameters for the simulation
# Set the domain size in non-dimensional coordinates
Lx = 10  # size in the x-direction
Lz = 1   # size in the vertical (z) direction 

# Set the grid size
Nx = 256  # number of gridpoints in the x-direction
Nz = 64   # number of gridpoints in the z-direction

# Some timestepping parameters
max_Δt = 0.02 # maximum allowable timestep 
duration = 20 # The non-dimensional duration of the simulation

# Set the Reynolds number (Re=Ul/ν)
Re = 5000
# Set the Prandtl number (Pr=ν/κ)
Pr = 1

# Parameters for the initial condition:
S₀=10 # maximum shear
N₀=sqrt(10) # maximum buoyancy frequency
h=0.1 # shear layer width

# Set the amplitude of the random perturbation (kick)
kick = 0.05

# construct a rectilinear grid using an inbuilt Oceananigans function
# Here, we use periodic (cyclic) boundary conditions in x
grid = RectilinearGrid(size = (Nx, Nz), x = (0, Lx), z = (0, Lz), topology = (Periodic, Flat, Bounded))

# No boundary conditions explicitly set - the BCs will default to free-slip and no-flux in z

# Now, define a 'model' where we specify the grid, advection scheme, bcs, and other settings
model = NonhydrostaticModel(; grid,
              advection = UpwindBiasedFifthOrder(),  # Specify the advection scheme.  Another good choice is WENO() which is more accurate but slower
            timestepper = :RungeKutta3, # Set the timestepping scheme, here 3rd order Runge-Kutta
                tracers = (:b),  # Set the name(s) of any tracers, here b is buoyancy
               buoyancy = Buoyancy(model=BuoyancyTracer()), # this tells the model that b will act as the buoyancy (and influence momentum) 
                closure = (ScalarDiffusivity(ν = 1 / Re, κ = 1 / Re)),  # set a constant kinematic viscosity and diffusivty, here just 1/Re since we are solving the non-dimensional equations 
                coriolis = nothing # this line tells the mdoel not to include system rotation (no Coriolis acceleration)
)

# Set initial conditions
# Here, we start with a tanh function for buoyancy and add a random perturbation to the velocity. 
uᵢ(x, y, z) = S₀ * h * tanh( (z - Lz/2) / h) + kick * randn()
vᵢ(x, y, z) = 0
wᵢ(x, y, z) = kick * randn()
bᵢ(x, y, z) = N₀^2 * h * tanh( (z - Lz/2) / h) + kick * randn()

# Send the initial conditions to the model to initialize the variables
set!(model, u = uᵢ, v = vᵢ, w = wᵢ, b = bᵢ)

# Now, we create a 'simulation' to run the model for a specified length of time
simulation = Simulation(model, Δt = max_Δt, stop_time = duration)

# ### Output
u, v, w = model.velocities # unpack velocity `Field`s
b = model.tracers.b # extract the buoyancy

# Now, calculate secondary quantities
# Oceananigans has functions to calculate derivatives on the model grid
